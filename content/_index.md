I believe technology is better when developed with empathy, and I’m exercising this belief currently as an Engineer at HashiCorp.  

I am Sylvia Moss, Computer Engineer and animal lover.  

Check out below some of the technologies and projects I’ve worked with. Contact me and let’s build some thoughtful, emphatic tech together!
